Cut and Add
Harry and Potter took a word string. Harry chose a number M (less than the length of the
string) and Potter chose N (less than the length of the string). Harry will cut M alphabets
from the end of the string and then add it to the beginning and will give it to Potter. Then,
Potter will also cut N alphabets from the end of the string, add it to the beginning and ther
give to Harry. This process will continue till they get the original word string back.
For a given string and given values of M and N, find the number of turns in which they wi
get the original word string back.
